<h1>BHARATHI NAGAR YOUTH ASSOCIATION (BNYA) <br><em>ALWAL</em></h1>
<h2>"Our Journey With Lord Ganesha"</h2>
<p><strong>We began in 2018 as a small gathering of friends and family, and have now blossomed into a grand celebration filled with devotion, creativity, and togetherness. Every year, from the moment we bring Bappa home to the heartfelt visarjan, we fill each day with joy, music, and love. Our team works hand in hand—decorating, organizing events, preparing prasad, and welcoming everyone with open hearts. For us, Ganesh Chaturthi is not just a festival—it's a tradition that binds us like family, and we're grateful to share this joy with our community.</strong></p>
